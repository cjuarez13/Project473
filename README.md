# Project Scope

Snark-A-Boss will allow users to anonymously snark on their bosses. It will allow them to search on any existing bosses that may be in the database and allow for bosses to be added. Under an existing boss, there will be a commenting area where comments will be sorted from newest to oldest. The ability to sort from oldest to newest will also be available.

Let them know how you really feel about them without getting caught!
